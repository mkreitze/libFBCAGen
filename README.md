# Preface

Fashion Based Cellular Automata (FBCA) are self organizing structures that are normal cellular automata with a governing rule set. This rule set allows a single cell of a FBCA to change its state to a nearby more desirable state by evaluating scores assigned to each cell. FBCAs have been found to be extremely useful for level-map genreation in videogames. This comes from an FBCA exhibiting local self organizing behaviour which, when paired with an inital random state, produce level-maps that have similar local behaviour but different overall configurations.
